when logging in to whale with naver id you may stay logged in for an extended period of time due to the characteristics of the browser if a user starts accessing whale while another user is logging on through a device that is shared by multiple persons there is the risk that whale settings are highly likely to be exported to the outside or to be arbitrarily changed each user is responsible for protecting their account information and the settings synchronized with their accounts by taking the proper protective action such as logout
for privacy issues whale allows users to choose between 1 automatic logout when closing the app and 2 data deletion these two options can be set individually in addition if you select public pc in settings the above two options will be applied at the same time so that users can protect their account information and the settings synchronized with their accounts

safe browsing
whale provides multiple protection functions to protect users from a variety of threats
1 safety function for authentication certificate
whale sends notifications to users after checking whether a website connection attempt is safe or not the message the website you are trying to access is not safe to connect to will appear when the authentication certificate for website connection is expired and there is a risk of hacking when you are trying to access a website based on an unsafe authentication certificate sha1 based etc or when you are trying to access a website using a forged authentication certificate
sending notification for safety (data) 
a green padlock icon appears on the address bar indicating a safe website by clicking on the icon you can check the details for the protective function applied however please be aware that it is not always possible to figure out the availability of a protective measure and its level as some websites set limited protective functions only for some parts such as the login entry form instead of for the entire webpage
in the whale for mobile the padlock icon may not be exposed but the safety function for authentication certificate will still be provided for further details refer to search address bar
2 phishing forged websites
when whale detects a risk of phishing from a certain website with the safe browsing function the message the website you are trying to access is not safe to connect to will appear a phishing site refers to a website manipulated to hack into users personal data
phishing forged websites (process) 
3 pharming forged websites
when whale detects a risk of phishing from a certain website with the safe browsing function the message the website you are trying to access is not safe to connect will appear pharming sites lead users to false websites even when they access authentic websites by typing in the right address on the address bar or clicking previously visited urls by contaminating the pc with malicious codes or hacking routers pharming sites refer to false websites manipulated to perform such malicious acts to detect and cope with a pharming risk naver collects and analyzes access records from websites likely to be attacked by pharming and compares those records to the ip addresses pool which naver previously collected and analyzed as highly likely to be attacked from pharmingtargeted sites in the case that a difference occurs between server time on the naver main webpage and local time identified in a users device naver collects data on each time and the time gap to cope with pharming
pharming forged websites(process) 
4 malware
when whale detects malware from a website that a user visits the message malware has been detected from the website you are trying to access will appear to detect and cope with malware the url header binary hash etc may be collected malware is malicious software used to steal or delete personal data after it is installed on your computer unknowingly

autofill
whale provides an autofill function that helps users enter repetitive data in a faster and more convenient way the autofill function is set as default but users are able to set the function to on or off at any time
using autofill function (process) 
users can manage the autofill items in whale settings and edit or delete the information as well as the information stored with the autofill function of whale is only used by naver for the purposes of improving whale there is no separate agreement procedure for collection and use
users can transfer autofill information to all of their devices set to use whale if needed by synchronizing the autofill data through the browser settings 
users also can transfer autofill information from browsers other than whale the type of information which can be imported to whale from other browsers is different for each browser and its availability can be checked through bookmark and settings import on whale 
synchronizing the autofill data between different browsers (data)
whale can provide a consistent user experience for multiple devices with such functions users therefore need to be aware of potential privacy infringement by other users especially when devices are shared or the autofill information is sent to devices vulnerable due to lack of security for further details refer to whale login explained above
whale supports geolocation api which allows a user to gain access to the browser location information if the user agrees to it when a certain website requests a users location information whale will ask for prior consent here without explicit consent by the user whale will not send the location information to the corresponding website whale provides ip locationbased information that naver has established on its own as ip location assumes an approximate location based on a users access ip address rather than measuring it with a specific device sometimes the location suggested by whale may not match with the actual location
the process of using location information (process) 
naver returns the ip addressbased location information only for a selective locationbased service here the returned location information will not be separately stored or used for other purposes the processing of the returned location information follows the websites user agreement or privacy protection policy whenever users visit websites that use location information whale requests for permission with a popup window through this users are able to approve or refuse collection of their location information for a website blocked from tracing location a block icon appears on the search bar in order to resume the use of location information at the website visited click the website information icon located in front of the url on the search address bar or go to whale settings
the process of collecting location information for websites (process) 
whale provides a unique function called quick search when users select quick search from the popup menu after selecting text by dragging or double click etc shown on webpages that they visit the search results will appear on the sidebar
search results coming from quick search are not presented simply corresponding to keywords selected by users rather as the results reflect user intention in the context of websites including keywords even texts similar to the selected words may be sent to the naver server whale only exposes results offered by naver after sending keywords through naver search api users quick search keywords will not be separately stored or used for other purposes all search keywords transmitted in this process are safely protected under the security 
if the autotranslation function is utilized whale automatically shows the translated results when the users access websites users can directly manage websites intended for translation in whale settings
the text of a website selected by a user for an automatic translation will be sent to the server at this time languages for translation both source and target languages will also be collected a secured connection is applied to the transmission section for texts intended for translation so as to be safely reported in the network transmission section data collected to provide the autotranslation function will not be dealt with in connection with user information but will be used only for the purpose of the autotranslation functions provision and improvement
autotranslation (process) 
users logged in with naver id may selectively use the function of download manager naver cloud connect upon login to whale a whale download folder will be automatically generated in the naver cloud users can store downloaded files in the folder after setting the saved path as naver cloud
the process of using cloud storage (process)

Our systems automatically analyze your data to power Evernote features and to continually improve the Evernote Service for you in a way that does not require anyone to look at your Content. This may include, for example:
Making sure you find what you’re looking for when you search your account.
Showing you information most relevant to how you are or could be using the Evernote Service at a specific time or location.
Suggesting actions for you to take based on information you’ve stored.
Suggesting Evernote Service features or products to you that we think will help you get the most out of the Evernote Service.
For Evernote Teams users, recommending people for you to collaborate with.
Maintaining our Services. To provide troubleshooting and customer support, our Customer Support team may need to access your information, such as your account email address and information about the Evernote application you are using, subject to the protections described below.  
Protecting against security threats, abuse, and illegal activity. As part of our efforts to protect your account and the functionality of the Evernote Service, our systems may analyze the emails you send to and from your Evernote account and the notes you share to detect spam, malware, or other potential security concerns. If we determine that such material constitutes a Terms of Service or User Guidelines violation, we may block delivery of or unshare the problematic material, much like a spam filter works for your email inbox.
Learn more about steps you can take to protect your account, such as using strong passwords, two-step verification, and encryption.
Communicating with you. In accordance with your communication preferences, we’ll occasionally contact you to announce new products and features we build for you, share tips for using Evernote to get more done, make special offers, and provide information about how Evernote works with products and services from our business partners.Learn MoreShow Less
Complying with Law. Evernote also uses information to satisfy applicable laws or regulations, and discloses information in response to legal process or enforceable government requests, including to law enforcement. For more information, please visit the section “How does Evernote respond to legal requests for my information?” of this Privacy Policy.
Would someone at Evernote ever view my Content?

You have control over who sees your Content. We limit the use of your Content to make sure that no one at Evernote can view it unless you expressly give us permission or it’s necessary to comply with our legal obligations. Specifically:

To help refine or improve the technology, we may ask you for permission to review portions of your Content. For example, if a new feature suggests related notes that are relevant to your Content, we may give you an opportunity to provide us feedback on how well the feature is performing along with a sample of the Content in question, so we can make sure this feature provides appropriately tailored suggestions. Such access to your Content is done only with your express permission and is subject to strict confidentiality rules and data access controls. Choosing to give us such permission is completely voluntary.
If you contact our Customer Support team for help with specific pieces of Content in your account (for example, if you can’t find a note you believe should be in your account), we may ask for your temporary permission to look at your Content. This permission terminates when the issue is resolved.Learn MoreShow Less
If we become aware of a potential violation of our Terms of Service or User Guidelines, we may suspend or close your account until the problematic material is removed. Under such a circumstance, we would only look at the Content in your account if you give us consent or if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, including to protect the safety of you or any other person.
To test and improve our product offerings for our users, we use aggregated data that does not contain any personal information, does not identify any person, and cannot be connected to any specific user. This policy is not intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.

How does Evernote share or disclose my information?
Evernote is not in the business of selling or renting your information. Here are instances when we may disclose your information — and then only the minimum information necessary:

We share your information with service providers who process data on our behalf, such as credit card processors and customer management systems. For example, these service providers help us:
Operate, develop, and improve the features and functionality of the Evernote Service
Complete your payment transactions
Fulfill your sales and support requests
Communicate with you as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy
We require these providers to agree to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our privacy policy standards and our obligations under data protection laws. We do not share your information with any third parties for their own advertising purposes.Learn MoreShow Less
Your Content is private unless you decide you want to share it. You may choose to share using public links or through any of the Evernote Service’s features that allow you to share or collaborate on Content (“Collaboration Features”). If you choose to share, we may need to take steps to facilitate your collaboration.  Learn MoreShow Less
In the event of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal.  
As described on our Cookie Information page, we contract with third-party advertising networks in order to deliver relevant Evernote advertisements to you across the Internet and to manage our communications with you. We do not use your Content for these purposes. In addition, we may share with partners or service providers a hashed identifier to serve you relevant Evernote ads when you visit partners’ and providers’ websites, applications or platforms. We may, for instance, participate in the Google Adwords Remarketing, Twitter Tailored Audience and Facebook Custom Audience services. To learn more about the privacy controls that Google, Twitter and Facebook offer and honor for those respective services, please visit here for Google, here for Twitter, and here for Facebook. You may opt out of certain ad targeting and retargeting services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page, or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page.
We also may exchange information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing. This includes, for example, if you connect your Evernote account with a third-party app in our App Center.Learn MoreShow Less
How does Evernote respond to legal requests for my information?
We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account. We will not disclose your information to law enforcement or other governmental authorities unless we believe it is required to comply with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, or other lawful government requests. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards of due process.
We narrowly interpret all information requests, and we only disclose Content in your account that is specifically responsive to a government warrant or where you have provided your explicit consent. In accordance with our Information for Law Enforcement Authorities page, we will notify you if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party’s legal demand for your information, and we routinely push back on government orders to delay user notice that we view as overly broad.
In addition, in rare cases, we may share your information as necessary to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Evernote Service, or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
How can I manage my information stored in Evernote?
In most cases, you can manage your information simply by logging into your account and editing your information directly within the Evernote Service.
If you prefer, you can contact us at privacy@evernote.com to ask us to provide access to, correct, update, or delete your personal information. Residents of certain regions may have additional or different rights in your personal information. Please see our Region-Specific Information Page for more information. 
How long does Evernote store my information?
We make the Content you store in Evernote readily accessible to you, until you make the decision to delete it.
If you delete your Content and then sync, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Evernote Service. The Evernote Service’s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
Evernote provides you with features that allow you to communicate and collaborate with other users. Deleting your copy of these communications (such as messages) won't delete copies existing in the accounts of people with whom you were interacting.
For users who are inactive for extended periods of time, we may close your account to satisfy our obligations under applicable law, and in accordance with our data retention policy. If that happens, we will try to notify you before taking any action.
What happens if I want to stop using Evernote?
As described above, you can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote Service at any time. You may also export your notes at any time, as explained here.
What happens if Evernote closes my account?
If Evernote deactivates your account due to a violation of our Terms of Service, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.
Where does Evernote store my information?
When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable applications, some of your data will be stored locally on that device.
When you sync your computing device with the Evernote Service, that data will be replicated on servers maintained in the United States. This means that if you store information in or submit data to the Evernote website or Evernote Software and sync such Evernote Software with the Evernote Service, you acknowledge your personal information will be transmitted to, hosted, and accessed in the United States.
Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from, or be more protective than, those in the United States. We will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, wherever it is processed.
Other information
Does Evernote allow children to use its Services?
The Evernote Service is designed for adults; we do not intend to collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@evernote.com.
How does Evernote respond to Do Not Track signals?
Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, Evernote does not currently respond to or otherwise take action in response to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites or online services. For information about Do Not Track, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
